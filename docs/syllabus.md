# Syllabus - Structured Programming 101

This course introduces basic concepts for creating computer
programs. Students learn these concepts by creating a program using
the [Processing](http://processing.org/) language and its integrated
development environment (IDE).

## Prerequisites

This course does not assume that the student has any prior familiarity
with programming or programming languages. Some familiarity with
computers (using a web browser, installing and opening programs, etc.)
is helpful. Conversely, those who are already familiar basic concepts
of programming may wish to skip to a more advanced course.

Any student wishing to follow along should download and install the
Processing IDE:

## Concepts

This course will cover the following concepts, in roughly the given
order:

  1. Processing - Running a Processing program, how does Processing
     relate to other languages/platforms.
  2. Syntax - The basic rules of how a program must be written.
  3. Data & Variables - Storing and manipulating data. Basic data types.
  4. Functions - Writing reusable sets of instructions.
  5. Flow control: if/then/else - Executing different code depending on
     some condition.
  6. Flow control: loops - Repeatedly executing similar instructions.
  7. Output - Displaying information to the user.

## TEKS

This course relates to
[TEKS 130.276: "Computer Programming"](http://ritter.tea.state.tx.us/rules/tac/chapter130/ch130k.html).

## Follow-up Courses

This course leads into the following TCMCF courses:

  * Structured Programming 201 - Covers more advanced programming
    topics.
  * Arduino 101 - The basic concepts from Structured Programming 101
    can be directly applied to programming an Arduino or any other
    microcontroller.

For highly interested students, there are many programming tutorials
and courses available online. There are many basic programming
tutorials on the internet. There are also several courses of study
that one can follow. Examples include Codeacademy
(http://www.codeacademy.com), and Coursera's programming course
(https://www.coursera.org/course/programming1).
